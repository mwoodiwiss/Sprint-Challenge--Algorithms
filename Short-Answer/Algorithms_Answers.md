## Exercise I

a) linear time


b)quadratic time


c)logarithmic time

## Exercise II

I would split the total number of floors in half then drop an egg from the highest floor of the first half.
If the egg breaks
    discard second half
    repeat from the first tep
if the egg doesn't break
    discard first half
    repeat from the first step

This would have logarithmic time because the number of floors are being decreased every step.
